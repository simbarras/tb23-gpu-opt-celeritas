## Generative AI and tools

To avoid all misunderstandings with the new chart of the HEIA-FR concerning the usage of tools issued from generative AI, I want to clarify.

As these are very powerful tools, I'm totally against the idea of banning them, and I'm looking instead for a way to increase my productivity by using them.
However, I do agree that productivity gains must not take precedence over the right to personal property, but I do have some reservations about the HEIA-FR guidelines.

When I code or write reports, I am accompanied by the "GitHub Copilot" tool.
This tool constantly generates suggestions that I accept, inspire or ignore.
You'll understand that it's not possible for me to define the exact lines generated.
In addition, this raises a question: if Copilot suggests the exact line I wanted to write and I accept its proposal, is it generated or not?
That's why you'll never find mention of generated lines unless I find the information relevant.

I use forums like Stackoverflow or chatbots like chatGPT in two ways.
The most common is to solve a bug where I can't find the solution right away.
The second is when I don't know how to do it and need an example.
In all cases, and whatever the tool, I try to describe my context as best I can and explain my problem.
The answers I receive are tested and understood so that they can be perfectly adapted to my situation and integrated.
Here again, you won't find any explicit mention in the code, except in relevant cases, as it's not possible for me to trace all my inspirations.

I should also mention that I do most of my work in English, so I use Deepl to translate texts, sentences and words.
For proofreading, I have a premium subscription to Antidote, which improves quality by highlighting errors.
Other proofreaders, translators and other tools will probably be used under my supervision.
Other sources such as Wikipedia or other sites and articles will be read for inspiration and mentioned if necessary.

Finally, even if there's no annotation mentioning the use of a tool, consider that everything I've done could have been manipulated by an AI or any other tool.
However, I remain the only captain of the ship and I assure you that I understand and am able to explain what is being produced.
This includes assuming all responsibility for the work I provide.
