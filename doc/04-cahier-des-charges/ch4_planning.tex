\chapter{Planning}
\label{spec:ch:planning}

To manage the projet, the project tool from GitHub will be used.
This allow to link code with issues that represent activities and add a better tracking of the project.
The planning is available on my personnal GitHub account~\cite{github-project}.

The following figure \ref{spec:fig:planning} show the planning of the project.
Normally, the bachelor thesis begin directly at the \acrshort{lbl} but due to the time required to get a visa, the plane has been delayed and the project has started in Switzerland.
The August 4th, the report need to be finished and sended to the \acrshort{heia} but the internship will continue until the end of August 11th.
This week will be use to finish the work on place and to present the work done to the team.
Exceptionally, the bachelor's thesis end date can be delayed up to one week due to the disagrement to obtain a visa.

The milestones represent the main steps of the project.
The mandatory objectives can be found in the milestones.
They are used to track the progress of each step and set a list of activities to do.

\label{spec:ch:planning:issues}

The issues are representing the tasks that need to be done to complete a milestone.
They can be detailed with a checklist to specify the steps to follow and they can be linked to a pull request to keep a reference to the code that solves the issue.
