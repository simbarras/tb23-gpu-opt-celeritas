\chapter{Activities}
\label{chap:activities}

Activities are all the tasks that need to be done to complete the project.
These tasks come directly from the goals.
The planning is based on the activities listed above.

\section{Control the $\mu$BoMa with a microcontroller}
\label{sec:activities:control}

This is the first step of the project, it will contain the main part of the analysis.
This task will be finished when the microdispenser will give a dose asked by the microcontroller.
This includes finishing the documentation and the tests.


\subsection{Find a microcontroller}
\label{sec:activities:control:find}

The microcontroller must meet all the requirements of the project.
It's important to find one that is available on the market and has the necessary pins to connect to the dispenser.
This task will be done in parallel with the other analysis tasks.


\subsection{Choose the programming language}
\label{sec:activities:control:language}

The programming language is an important choice because it will be used for the rest of the project.
This task belongs to the analysis too.

\subsection{Setup the development environment}
\label{sec:activities:control:environment}

The development environment is the tools that will be used to develop the software.
It's important to choose the right tools to be able to work efficiently and join the DevOps recommendations.

\subsection{Connect the microcontroller to the dispenser}
\label{sec:activities:control:connect}

This step is a bottle neck because it will block the other ones.
It may require skills in electronics and it may be done by someone else.

\subsection{Develop the controller software}
\label{sec:activities:control:software}

That is the main one of the first goal.
It includes the implementation and the tests of the controller part of the software.

\subsection{Write the documentation}
\label{sec:activities:control:documentation}

The implementation of this goal will be written in parallel with all the other tasks of this goal.



\section{Read the information of the microdispenser}
\label{sec:activities:read}

This task is the second goal of the project and it will continue the work done in the first goal.
The programming language and the microcontroller will be the same as the one used in the past.
The tools to test the software will be increased to include the test of this part.
This task will be marked as done when the microcontroller will be able to read the information of the microdispenser and the documentation will be written.


\subsection{Develop the reader software}
\label{sec:activities:read:software}

This task is the main one of the second goal and it will include the implementation and the tests of the reader part of the software.
An important part, it's to create separate modules to increase the scalability of the software.

\subsection{Write the documentation}
\label{sec:activities:read:documentation}

This task will close the second goal.


\section{Provide an interface to manage the microdispenser}
\label{sec:activities:interface}

This task is the last mandate goal of the project.
It will be repeated for each interface that will be developed for this project.
To complete this task, the application interface on the server part will be totally functional and tested.
The documentation must also be up to date.

\subsection{Analyze the best interface}
\label{sec:activities:interface:network}

The protocol and the support will be chosen according to the needs of the client.
This includes investigating the best network and the best protocol to meet the requirements.
It will be documented in the analysis.


\subsection{Develop the interface}
\label{sec:activities:interface:develop}

When the network will be chosen, the interface will be developed.
This task includes the tests and like the second goal, the code will be written in a way that it can be easily modified.

\subsection{Follow an optional standard}
\label{sec:activities:interface:standard}

This step is optional but it must have been analyzed before to be added to the project if there some time left.

\subsection{Write the documentation}
\label{sec:activities:interface:documentation}

This task will be done in parallel with the other tasks of this goal.
