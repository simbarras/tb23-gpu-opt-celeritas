\chapter{Executive summary}
\label{ch:report-executive-summary}

This report is the result of the work done by Simon Barras during his semester project (PS6) at the \acrshort{heia}.

The goal of this project was to start the development of the connected part of a microdispenser.
This report will present the work done but it also contains the guidelines to continue the project.
The project was wide and it was impossible to do everything in one semester, not to mention that I've had a lot of problems.
The environment to put in place to work on the project is also described.
