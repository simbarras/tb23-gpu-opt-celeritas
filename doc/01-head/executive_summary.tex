\chapter{Executive Summary}
\label{ch:report-executive-summary}

This Bachelor thesis has been made by Simon Barras, a student of the \acrlong{heia}.
The goal is to improve the performance of the Celeritas, a Monte Carlo particle
transport library for simulating \acrfull{hep} detectors.
tool for high-energy physics.
This project is accelerated by \acrshort{gpu}s and the focus is on
the improvement of the \acrshort{rkdp} algorithm.
This famous sequential method needs to be analyzed to define the best way to
parallelize it.
The final goal is to implement a distributed version of the \acrshort{rkdp}
with multiple \acrshort{gpu}s threads that work together to simulate a large
number of particles.
