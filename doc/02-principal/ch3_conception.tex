\chapter{Conception}
\label{ch:conception}

The project is focusing on optimizing the \acrlong{rkdp} algorithm
in a context of \acrshort{gpu} computing.
The conception of the project is finding all the possible adaptations that could
decrease the execution time of the algorithm.

\section{RKDP algorithm}
\label{ch:conception:rkdp}

This method has nine stages and is a fifth-order accurate method.
The first six stages are used to compute the end state, the seventh stage is used
the seventh state and the last two stages are used to compute the error and the
middle state.
